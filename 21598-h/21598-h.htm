<h2>THE SCHOOL FOR PATRIOTISM.</h2>


<p class="note">[A Fund has been raised to supply the School Board with Union-Jacks,
with a view to increasing the loyalty of the pupils.&mdash;<i>Daily Paper.</i>]</p>


<blockquote><span class="smcap">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A Room of the School Board, decorated with flags and trophies
of arms.</i> Teacher <i>discovered instructing his pupils in English
History.</i></blockquote>


<p><i>Teacher.</i> And now we come to the Battle of Trafalgar, which was won
by <span class="smcap">Nelson</span> in the early part of the present century. As it is my object
to increase your patriotism, I may tell you that "<span class="smcap">Britannia</span> rules the
waves, and Britons never, never, never will be slaves!" Repeat that in
chorus.</p>

<p><i>Pupils.</i> "Rule, <span class="smcap">Britannia, Britannia</span> rules the waves; Britons never,
never, never will be slaves!"</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> Thank you very much; and to show how the <i>esprit de corps</i>
in Her Majesty's Ships-of-War is preserved, I will now dance the
Sailor's Hornpipe.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>Does so.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>First Pupil.</i> Please, Sir, do Englishmen always win?</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> Invariably. If they retire, they do not retreat. Can you
tell me what a retirement of troops in the face of the enemy is
called?</p>

<p><i>Second Pupil.</i> Bolting, Sir.</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> Nothing of the sort. Go to the bottom of the class, Sirrah!
Bolting, indeed! Next boy!</p>

<p><i>Third Pupil.</i> It is called "a strategic movement to the rear," Sir.</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> Quite right; and now we come to the Battle of Waterloo,
which you will remember was won on the 18th of June, 1815. But perhaps
this may be a convenient time for the introduction of the Union-Jack
War Dance, which, as you all know, has been recently ordered to be
part of our studies by the Committee of the School Board. Now then,
please, take your places.</p>

<blockquote><p>[The Pupils <i>seize the flags hanging to the walls, and dance merrily.
At the conclusion of the exercise they replace the flags, and resume
their customary places.</i></p></blockquote>

<p><i>First Pupil.</i> If you please, can you tell us anything about the
Union-Jack?</p>

<p><i>Teacher.</i> As I have explained on many occasions, when you have been
good and obliging enough to put the same question to me, I am
delighted to have the opportunity. You must know that the Union-Jack
represents the greatest nation in the world. This nation is our own
beloved country, and it is gratifying to know that there are no people
so blessed as our own. The Union-Jack flies in every quarter of the
globe, and where it is seen, slavery becomes impossible, and tyranny a
thing of the past. To be an Englishman is to be the noblest creature
on the earth. One Englishman is worth twenty specimens of other
nationalities; he is more conscientious, more clever, more beautiful
than any other living man, and it is a good thing for the world that
he exists. <i>(Looking at watch.</i>) And now, as we have rather exceeded
our usual time for study, we will depart after the customary ceremony.</p>

<blockquote><p>[<i>The</i> Pupils <i>then sing the National Anthem, and the School dismisses
itself with three cheers for</i> <span class="smcap">Her Majesty</span>. <i>Curtain.</i></p></blockquote>

<h2>BUTTERS BUTTERED.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have been deeply thrilled by the suggestion for curing the
Agricultural depression which Messrs. <span class="smcap">Macdougall</span>, of Mark Lane, have
made. I am not myself an Agriculturist; still, in&mdash;or rather near&mdash;the
suburban villa in which I reside, I have an old cow, and a donkey on
which my children ride. Directly I heard that the way to keep animals
warm and comfortable in Winter was to smear them all over with oil,
thus saving much of the cost of feeding them, I tried the plan on the
aged cow. Perhaps the oil I used was not sufficiently pure. At all
events the animal, which had never been known before to do more than
proceed at a leisurely walk, rushed at frantic speed into the garden,
and tossed my wife's mother into a cucumber-frame. She has now gone
home. Undeterred by the comparative failure of this attempt, I smeared
our donkey with a pint of the best castor-oil, just before setting out
on its daily amble, with the children (in panniers) on its back. It
did not appear to relish the treatment, as it instantly broke loose,
and was found, five miles off, in a village pound, while the children
were landed in a neighbouring ditch. I am writing to Messrs.
<span class="smcap">Macdougall</span>, to ask for particulars of how the oil is to be applied. I
am sure it is an excellent idea, if the animals could be brought to
see it in the same light.</p>

<p class="indent">Yours, experimentally,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Darwin Edison Gubbins</span>.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Mr. Punch,&mdash;Smith</span> Minor, who is staying at our house for part
of the holidays, said what good fun it would be to try the <span class="smcap">Macdougall</span>
plan on my Uncle from India. He is always cold and shivering. We
waited till he was having a nap after dinner in the arm-chair, and we
coated him over with butter that <span class="smcap">Smith</span> Minor got from Cook. (Cook
never will give <i>me</i> butter.) When we got to his hair he unfortunately
woke up, so that is probably why the plan did not succeed. We thought
he would be pleased to feel warmer, but he wasn't. Uncles are often
ungrateful, <span class="smcap">Smith</span> Minor says. And it <i>did</i> succeed in one way, because
he seemed awfully hot and red in the face when he found what we had
been doing. Perhaps we ought not to have tried smearing him on his
clothes, but how could we get his clothes off without waking him?
<span class="smcap">Smith</span> Minor says it's a pity we didn't drug him. N.B.&mdash;I have been
stopped going to the Pantomime for this, and <span class="smcap">Smith</span> Minor is to be sent
home!</p>

<p class="indent">Your dejected</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Tommy</span>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I want to bring an action against Messrs. <span class="smcap">Macdougall</span>, of Mark
Lane. I tried their smearing plan on a horse in my stable that had a
huge appetite, and was always getting cold if left out in the wet. I
used paraffin, and at first the animal seemed really grateful. In the
night I was called up by a fearful noise, and found that the horse's
appetite had not got at all less owing to the oil; on the contrary, it
seemed to have eaten up most of the woodwork of the stable, and was
plunging about madly. The paraffin caught light, and the stable was
burned, and the horse too. In future I shall feed my horse in the
usual way, not on the outside.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_MAN_WHO_WOULD" id="THE_MAN_WHO_WOULD"></a>THE MAN WHO WOULD.</h2>

<h3>VI.&mdash;THE MAN WHO WOULD BE A SOUL.</h3>


<p><span class="smcap">Lincoln B. Swezey</span> was a high-toned and inquiring American citizen, who
came over to study our Institootions. He carried letters to almost
everybody; Dukes, Radicals, Authors, eminent British Prize-fighters,
Music-hall buffoons, and he prosecuted his examination steadily. He
did not say much, and he never was seen to laugh, but he kept a
note-book, and he seemed to contemplate in his own mind, The Ideal
American, and to try to live up to that standard. When he did speak,
it was in the interrogative, and he pastured his intellect on our
high-class Magazines.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lincoln B.</span> discovered many things, and noted them down for his work on
<i>Social Dry Rot in Europe</i>, but one matter puzzled him. He read in
papers or reviews, and he vaguely heard talk of a secret institution,
the Society of Souls. They were going to run a newspaper; they were
<i>not</i> going to run a newspaper. There was a poem in connection with
them, which mystified <span class="smcap">Lincoln B. Swezey</span> not a little; he "allowed it
was darned personal," but further than that his light did not
penetrate. He went to a little Club, of which he was a temporary
member; it was not fashionable, and did not seem to want to be, and
<span class="smcap">Swezey</span> thought it flippant. There he asked, "What <i>are</i> the Souls,
anyhow?" "<i>Societas omnium animarum</i>," somebody answered, and <span class="smcap">Swezey</span>
exclaimed "Say!" "They are a congregation of ladies. Their statutes
decree that they are to be <i>bene nat&aelig;, bene vestit&aelig;</i>, and
<i>mediocriter</i>,&mdash;I don't remember what."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Swezey</span> perceived that he was being trifled with, and turned the
conversation to the superior culture and scholarship of American
politicians, with some thoughts on canvas-backed ducks.</p>

<p>He next applied to a lady, whom he regarded as at once fashionable and
well-informed, and asked her, "Who the Souls were, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Oh, a horrid, stuck-up set of people," said this Pythoness. "They
have passwords, and wear a silver gridiron."</p>

<p>"Why on earth do they do that?" asked <span class="smcap">Swezey</span>.</p>

<p>"No doubt for some improper, or blasphemous reason. Don't be a
Soul&mdash;you had better be a Skate. I am a Skate. We wear a silver skate,
don't you see" (and she showed him a model of an Acme Skate in
silver), "with the motto, <i>Celer et Audax</i>&mdash;'Fast and Forward.'"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Swezey</span> expressed his pride at being admitted to these mysteries&mdash;but
still pursued his inquiries.</p>

<p>"What do the Souls <i>do</i>?"</p>

<p>"All sorts of horrid things. They have a rule that no Soul is ever to
speak to anybody who is not a Soul, in society, you know. And they
have a rule that no Soul is ever to marry a Soul."</p>

<p>"Exogamy!" said <span class="smcap">Swezey</span>, and began to puzzle out the probable results
and causes of this curious prohibition.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean," said the lady, "and I don't know why you
are so curious about them. They all read the same books at the same
time, and they sacrifice wild asses at the altar of the Hyperborean
Apollo, <span class="smcap">Ibsen</span>, you know."</p>

<p>These particulars were calculated to excite <span class="smcap">Swezey</span> in the highest
degree. He wrote a letter on the subject to the <i>Chanticleer</i>, a
newspaper in Troy, Ill., of which he was a correspondent, and it was
copied, with zinco-type illustrations, into all the journals of the
habitable globe, and came back to England like the fabled boomerang.
Meanwhile <span class="smcap">Swezey</span> was cruising about, in town and country, looking
out for persons wearing silver gridirons. He never found any, and the
more he inquired, the more puzzled he became. He was informed that a
treatise on the subject existed, but neither at the British Museum,
nor at any of the newspaper offices, could he obtain an example of
this rare work, which people asserted that they had seen and read.</p>

<p>Finally <span class="smcap">Swezey</span> made the acquaintance of a lady who was rumoured darkly
to be learned in the matter. To her he poured forth expressions of his
consuming desire to be initiated, and to sacrifice at the shrine.</p>

<p>"There is not any shrine," said his acquaintance.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 33%">
<a href="./images/016.png"><img src="images/016.png" width="100%" alt="Then what in the universe is it all about?" title="" /></a><br />
&quot;Then what in the universe is it all about?&quot;
</div>

<p>"Well, I guess I want bad to be a Soul&mdash;an honorary one, of course&mdash;a
temporary member."</p>

<p>"There are conditions," said the Priestess.</p>

<p>"If there's a subscription"&mdash;&mdash;<span class="smcap">Swezey</span> began.</p>

<p>"There is not any subscription."</p>

<p>"If there's an oath"&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is not any oath."</p>

<p>"Well what are the conditions, anyhow?"</p>

<p>"Are you extremely beautiful?"</p>

<p>Among the faults of <span class="smcap">Swezey</span>, personal vanity was not reckoned. He shook
his head sadly, at the same time intimating that he guessed no one
would turn round in Broadway to look at the prettiest Englishwoman
alive.</p>

<p>Afterwards, he reflected that this was hardly the right thing to have
said.</p>

<p>"Are you extremely diverting?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Swezey</span> admitted that gaiety was not his forte. Still, he pined for
information.</p>

<p>"What does the Society <i>do</i>?" he asked.</p>

<p>"There is not any Society."</p>

<p>"Then why do they call themselves Souls?"</p>

<p>"But they don't call themselves anything whatever."</p>

<p>"Then why are they called Souls?"</p>

<p>"Because they&mdash;&mdash;but no! That is the Mystery which cannot be divulged
to the profane."</p>

<p>"Then what in the universe is it all about?" asked <span class="smcap">Swezey</span>; but this
was a problem to which no answer was vouchsafed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Swezey</span> is still going around, and still asking questions. But he has
moments of despondency, in which he is inclined to allow that the poor
islanders possess, after all, something akin to that boasted
inheritance of his native land, the Great American Joke. "Guess
they've played it on me," is the burden of his most secret
meditations.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Aladdin</span> at the Alhambra is a genuine "Ballet Extravaganza," the story
being told in pantomimic action, illustrated by <span class="smcap">M. Jacobi's</span>
sympathetic music. <i>Aladdin</i> was an excellent subject for Mr. <span class="smcap">John
Hollingshead</span> to take, though I venture to think that our old friend
<i>Blue Beard</i> would be a still better one. The only fault I find with
<i>Aladdin</i> is that it is too soon over. It certainly will take rank
among the most superb and the most dramatic spectacles ever placed on
the Alhambra stage. <i>Aladdin</i> ought to have been made much more of, as
a sort of <i>L'Enfant Prodigue.</i> What a chance there would have been for
him in games with the street-boys! Mlle. <span class="smcap">Legnani</span>&mdash;so called, of
course, from the graceful facility with which she remains for several
seconds at a time on one leg&mdash;is both a pretty and nimble
representative of the Dancing Princess. The <i>Slave of the Ring</i> does
not appear in this story, as far as I could gather, only the <i>Spirit
of the Lamp</i>, Signorina <span class="smcap">Pollini</span>, puts in an appearance, and a very
splendid appearance it is too! Mr. <span class="smcap">John Hollingshead</span> is to be
congratulated on having struck out a new line&mdash;though how he or the
<span class="smcap">Lord Chamberlain</span> could "<i>strike out a new line</i>" where there is no
dialogue, will ever remain a mystery, even to <span class="smcap">M. Jacobi</span> who knows most
things well, and music better than anything. Mlle. <span class="smcap">Marie</span> is a
sprightly <i>Aladdin</i>, her pantomimic action being remarkably good. How
many <i>Aladdins</i> have I seen! Whatever may become of other fairy
tales&mdash;though all the best fairy tales are immortal&mdash;this of <i>Aladdin</i>
will serve the stage for ever. At least, so thinks <span class="smcap">Private Box</span>.</p>

report that Mr. <span class="smcap">Gladstone</span>, during his stay at Biarritz, used up his
spare moments by studying the Basque tongue. <span class="smcap">Autolycus</span> hears that,
contrary to his usual habit, the Right Hon. Gentleman has in this

addresses the <span class="smcap">Speaker</span> in Welsh. Mr. <span class="smcap">Gladstone</span>, desiring to add a fresh

immediately follow the Hon. Member for the Rhondda Vally, and continue

<h2><a name="BUILDING_THE_SNOW_MAN" id="BUILDING_THE_SNOW_MAN"></a>BUILDING THE SNOW MAN.</h2>

<div class="poem"><p><span class="smcap">Billy</span> and <span class="smcap">Johnnie</span> were two little boys,</p>
<p>Who wearied of lessons, and tired of their toys.</p>
<p>Says <span class="smcap">Billy</span>, "I've hit on an excellent plan;</p>
<p>Let's go out in the cold, <span class="smcap">John</span>, and build a Snow Man!"</p>
</div>

<p><i>Johnnie</i> (<i>blowing his fingers</i>). Oh, I say, <span class="smcap">Billy</span>, isn't it cold,
either?</p>

<p><i>Billy</i> (<i>stamping</i>). <i>Is</i> it, <span class="smcap">Johnnie</span>? I haven't noticed it myself.</p>

<p><i>Johnnie.</i> Oh, you're as hard as nails, <i>you</i> are. <i>My</i> fingers are
quite numb.</p>

<p><i>Billy.</i> Then work away briskly. <i>That'll</i> warm 'em! Snow's a bit less
binding than I expected to find it. Result of the severe frost, I
suppose. But peg away, and we shall podge it into shape yet, <span class="smcap">Johnnie</span>.</p>

<p><i>Johnnie.</i> Ye-e-e-s! (<i>Shivers</i>). But what&mdash;er&mdash;er&mdash;what pattern, or
plan, or model, have we&mdash;that&mdash;is&mdash;er&mdash;have <i>you</i>&mdash;er&mdash;decided on,
<span class="smcap">Billy</span>?</p>

<p><i>Billy</i> (<i>winking</i>). Well, that's as it happens, <span class="smcap">Johnnie</span>! Remember the
one we built in '86&mdash;eh?</p>

<p><i>Johnnie</i> (<i>shuddering</i>). I should think I did. Don't mean to say
we're to go on <i>those</i> lines again, <span class="smcap">Billy</span>?</p>

<p><i>Billy.</i> I mean to <i>say</i> nothing of the kind. Many things have
happened since then, <span class="smcap">Johnnie</span>. For one thing, we've had heaps of
advice.</p>

<p><i>Johnnie.</i> Hang it, yes! And where are the advisers? Standing aloof
and criticising our work&mdash;<i>in advance</i>. Where's that bold, blusterous,
bumptious Behemoth, <span class="smcap">Bill Stead</span>? Knew all about building Snow Men, <i>he</i>
did; had a private monopoly of omniscience in that, as in most other
things, <span class="smcap">Bill</span> had. And now he's licking creation into shape for
six-pence a month, and shying stones at us whenever he sees a chance.
Little cocksure <span class="smcap">Labby</span>, too! Oh, <i>he</i>'s a nice boy! If <span class="smcap">Bill</span> takes all
Knowledge for his province, <span class="smcap">Henry</span> considers himself sole proprietor of
<i>Truth</i>, and he lets us <i>have</i> Truth&mdash;<i>his</i> Truth&mdash;every week at
least&mdash;in hard chunks&mdash;that hurt horribly. All in pure friendliness,
too, as the Bobby said when he knocked the boy down to save him from
being run over. Gr-r-r-r! Believe he's hiding behind the hedge there,
with a pile of hard snowballs to pelt our Man out of shape as soon as
we've licked him into it&mdash;if ever we do. <span class="smcap">Teddy Reed</span>, too, <i>he</i>'s
turned nasty, though he <i>does</i> come from "gallant little Wales;" and
now here's <span class="smcap">Wallace</span>, the Scotch boy&mdash;though <i>he</i> was all right
anyhow!&mdash;cutting up rough at the last moment, and complaining of our
Snow Man (which they've all been howling for for six years), because
he fancies its head is likely to be a little too Hibernian for his
Caledonian taste! Oh, they're a nice loyal, grateful lot, <span class="smcap">Billy</span>! And
where are the Irish bhoys themselves, in whose interests we are
freezing our fingers and nipping our noses? Standing off-and-on, as it
were, bickering like blazes among themselves, and only uniting to land
<i>us</i> a nasty one now and then&mdash;just to encourage us!</p>

<p><i>Billy</i> (<i>patting and punching away vigorously</i>). Loyal? Grateful? Ah,
<span class="smcap">Johnnie</span>, you don't understand 'em as well as I do. Cold has got on
your liver. You're a brave boy, <span class="smcap">Johnnie</span>, but just a bit bilious.
Building Snow Men isn't just like arranging bouquets, my boy. Let them
bicker, <span class="smcap">Johnnie</span>, and <i>listen to what they say</i>! It may all come in
handy by-and-by. We've had gratuitous advice and volunteer plans all
round, from <span class="smcap">Arty Balfour</span> and <span class="smcap">Joey Chamberlain</span>, as well as <span class="smcap">Henry</span>, and
<span class="smcap">Teddy</span>, and <span class="smcap">Tim</span> and <span class="smcap">John E.</span>, and the rest of 'em. Let them talk whilst
we build, <span class="smcap">Johnnie</span>. 'Tis a cold, uncomfortable job, I admit; and
whether "friendly" advice or hostile ammunition will do us the most
damage I hardly know&mdash;yet. Fierce foes are sometimes easier to deal
with than friendly funkers. A "Thunderer" in open opposition affrights
a true Titan less than a treacherous Thersites in one's own camp. But,
<span class="smcap">Johnnie</span>, we've got to build up this Snow Man somehow, and on some
plan! I only hope (<i>entre nous</i>, <span class="smcap">Johnnie</span>) that a thaw won't set in,
and melt it out of form and feature before it is fairly finished!</p>

<h2>CONVERSATIONAL HINTS FOR YOUNG SHOOTERS.</h2>


<p>Before I proceed with the order of subjects which I have proposed to
myself as the proper one to follow, I feel that I must revert for a
moment to the question of "ladies at lunch." You may remember that
some two or three weeks ago I ventured to offer some observations on
this topic. Dear ladies, you can read for yourselves the winged words
in which your adoring <i>Punch</i> settled the matter. "By all means," I
said, "come to lunch, if you must." What can be plainer or more
direct? Bless your pretty, pouting faces, I am not responsible for the
characters of my fellow-men, nor for the harsh language they use. If
they behave like boors, and show an incomprehensible distaste for your
delightful presence, am I, your constant friend, to be blamed? I
cannot alter the nature of these barbarians. But what has happened
since I published an article which had, at any rate, the merit of
truthful portraiture? Why, I have been overwhelmed with epistolary
reproaches in every variety of feminine hand-writing. "<span class="smcap">A Careful
Mother</span>" writes from Dorset&mdash;a locality hitherto associated in my mind
with butter rather than with blame&mdash;to protest that she has been so
horrified by my cynical tone, that she does not intend to take me in
any longer. She adds, that "<i>Punch</i> has laid upon my drawing-room
table for more than thirty years." Heavens, that I should have been so
deeply, so ungrammatically, honoured without knowing it! Am I no
longer to recline amid photograph albums, gift-books, and
flower-vases, upon that sacred table? And are you, Madam, to spite a
face which has always, I am certain, beamed upon me with a kindly
consideration, by depriving it wantonly of its adorning and necessary
nose. Heaven forbid! Withdraw for both our sakes that rash decision,
while there is yet time, and restore me to my wonted place in your
affections, and your drawing-room.</p>

<p>But all are not like this. Here, for instance, is a sensible and
temperate commentary, which it gives me pleasure to quote word for
word as it was written:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;I want to tell you that, although I am what one of
your friends called "a solid woman," and ought to feel <i>deeply</i> hurt
by what you said about ladies at lunch, yet I liked that article the
best. I think it was <i>awfully</i> good. But don't you think you are all
rather hard on ladies at shooting-boxes? My idea is that there ought
to be some new rules about shooting-parties. At present, ladies are
asked to amuse the men&mdash;at least that is my experience&mdash;and it is
rather hard they may not sometimes go on the moors, if they want to.
But, at the same time, I <i>quite</i> understand that they are horribly in
the way, and I am not surprised that the men don't want women about
them when they are shooting. But couldn't they arrange to have a day
now and then, when they could shoot all the morning, and devote
themselves to amusing the women on the moors after lunch? Otherwise, I
think there ought to be a rule that no women are to be invited to
shooting-boxes. It is generally very dull for the women, and I feel
sure the men would be quite as happy without them. I suppose the host
might want his wife to be there, to look after things; but <i>she ought
to strike</i>, and ask her lady-friends to do the same; and then they
could go abroad, or to some jolly place, and enjoy themselves in their
own way. Really we often get quite angry&mdash;at least I do&mdash;when men
treat us as if we were so many dolls, and patronise us in their heavy
way, and expect us to believe that the world was made entirely for
them and their shooting-parties. There must be more give and take.
And, if <i>we</i> are to give you our sympathy and attention, <i>you</i> must
take our companionship a little oftener. We get so dull when we are
all together.</p>

<p class="indent">Your sincere admirer,</p>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">A Lady Luncher</span>.</p>

<p>I confess this simple letter touched an answering chord in my heart. I
scarcely knew how to answer it. At last a brilliant thought struck me.
I would show it to my tame Hussar-Captain, <span class="smcap">Shabrack</span>. That gallant son
of Mars is not only a good sportsman, but he has, in common with many
of his brother officers, the reputation of being a dashing, but
discriminating worshipper at the shrine of beauty. At military and
hunt balls the Captain is a stalwart performer, a despiser of mere
programme engagements, and an invincible cutter-out of timid youths
who venture to put forward their claims to a dance that the Captain
has mentally reserved for himself. The mystery is how he has escaped
scathless into what his friends now consider to be assured
bachelor-hood. Most of his contemporaries, roystering, healthy, and
seemingly flinty-hearted fellows, all of them, have long since gone
down, one after another, before some soft and smiling little being,
and are now trying to fit their incomes to the keep of perambulators,
as well as of dog-carts. But <span class="smcap">Shabrack</span> has escaped. I found him at his
Club, and showed him the letter, requesting him at the same time to
tell me what he thought of it. I think he was flattered by my appeal,
for he insisted on my immediate acceptance of a cigar six inches long,
and proposed to me a tempting list of varied drinks. The Captain read
the letter through twice carefully, and thus took up his parable:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Look here, my son, don't you be put off by what the little woman
says. She don't mean half of it. Get the hostess to strike!"&mdash;here he
laughed loudly&mdash;"now that's a real good 'un. Why, they haven't got it
in them. Fact is, they can't stand one another's company. She says as
much, don't she? 'We get so dull when we are all together.' Well, that
scarcely looks like goin' off on the strike together, does it? Don't
you be alarmed, old quill-driver, they'll never run a strike of that
kind for more than a day. They'll all come troopin' back, beggin' to
be forgiven, and all that, and, by gum, we shall have to take 'em back
too, just as we're all congratulatin' ourselves that we shan't have to
go to any more blessed pic-nics. That's a woman's idea of enjoyin'
herself in the country&mdash;nothin' but one round of pic-nics. I give you
my word, when I was stayin' with old <span class="smcap">Fred Derriman</span>, in Perthshire,
they reg'larly mapped out the whole place for pic-nics, and I'm dashed
if they didn't spoil our best day's drivin by pic-nickin' in, 'oh,
such a sweet<span class='pagenum'><a name="page23" id="page23">[pg 23]</a></span> place.' Truth is, they can't get along without us, my
son, only they won't admit it, bless 'em! And, after all, we're better
off when they're in the house, I'm bound to confess; so I don't mind
lettin' 'em have a pic-nic or two, just to keep 'em sweet. Them's my
sentiments, old cock, and you're welcome to them."</p>

<p>I thanked the Captain for his courtesy, and withdrew. But if the whole
thing is merely a matter of pic-nics, it is far simpler than I
imagined.</p>

<p>"Have you read," asks one of the Baron's Assistants of his Chief,
"Miss <span class="smcap">Braddon</span>'s Christmas Annual? It is entitled, <i>The Misletoe
Bough</i>, and contains some of the best short stories I have read
lately. One of them, 'In Mr. <span class="smcap">Cartwright</span>'s Library,' is a remarkable
combination of quaint, dry humour, and literary skill. Who is the
clever author? But here are other stories, too, that interest and
please, and, not least among them, a charming sketch, by the ever
welcome editress. Bravo, Miss <span class="smcap">Braddon</span>!</p>

<p>"<i>Brownies and Rose-leaves</i>, by <span class="smcap">Roma White</span> (<span class="smcap">Innes &amp; Co.</span>), is a pretty
little book, prettily written, prettily illustrated by <span class="smcap">Leslie Brooke</span>,
and prettily bound," he continues. "Miss <span class="smcap">White</span> has a charming knack of
writing musical verse, simple, rhythmical, delightful. To children and
their parents, I say, take my tip (the only one parents will get at
this season), and read <span class="smcap">Roma White</span>'s dainty, delicate, fresh and breezy
book."</p>

<h2><a name="ROBIN_POOR_FELLOW" id="ROBIN_POOR_FELLOW"></a>ROBIN POOR FELLOW!</h2>


<p><i>Robin Goodfellow</i>, by Mr. <span class="smcap">Carton</span>, is not a brilliant play, as its
dialogue lacks epigrammatic sparkle: neither is it an interesting
play, as the plot, such as it is, is too weak for words,&mdash;which, by
the way, at once accounts for the absence of the sparkle
above-mentioned.</p>

<p>Three questions must have occurred to those who have already seen the
play, and which those who may hereafter see it will be sure to ask
themselves,&mdash;and they are these:&mdash;</p>

Nearly burning his fingers. Mr. Hare acting with
Grace.
</div>

<p>First. Why should <i>Grace's</i> father, <i>Valentine Barbrook</i>, tell her of
the means by which he had brought about the betrothal of <i>Hugh Rokeby</i>
to <i>Constance</i>?</p>

<p>Secondly. This being so, why allow six weeks to elapse when a word
from the one girl, who knows, to the other, who doesn't, would explain
everything?</p>

<p>Thirdly. If a sudden shock would kill the grandmother, surely, in the
course of six weeks, <i>Grace</i> would have found out that her shortest
and best way was to tell the truth to her cousin, without mentioning
it to the old lady.</p>

<p>If in doubt, why didn't she confide in the Doctor, who would at once
have told her whether the nature of the communication she had to make
was of a sufficiently startling nature to kill the old lady right off
or not?</p>

<p>The fact is, it was necessary to keep the lover, <i>Mr. Stanley
Trevenen</i>, away for some time, in order to allow of there being a
glimmer of probability in the announcement of his having thrown over
the girl to whom he is devotedly attached, and having married somebody
else whom he met abroad. "Now," says the dramatist, "what is the
shortest possible space of time I can allow for this? Ahem!&mdash;say a
month." So he gives him a month. "Then," says he, next, "what is the
shortest possible time we can allow for an engagement and a marriage?
Say six weeks. Good. Six weeks be it. Only, hang it, this muddle has
to last for six weeks! Well, it can't be helped. I can't give any more
trouble to the bothering plot; and, as after all, there's a capital
character for Mr. <span class="smcap">Hare</span>, and not at all a bad one for Miss <span class="smcap">Rorke</span>, with
a fairish one for <span class="smcap">Forbes Robertson</span>, why, if Mr. <span class="smcap">Hare</span> will accept the
play, and do it, I should say that, cast and played as it will be, it
is pretty sure to be a success."</p>

The Happy Pair.
</div>

<p>So much for the Author and the Play. As to the Actors, Mr. <span class="smcap">Hare</span> has
had many a better part, and this is but an inferior species of a genus
with which the public has long been familiar; but there is no one who
can touch him in a part of this description. Admirable! most
admirable! <i>Barbrook</i> is in reality a silly elderly scamp, with all
the will to be a villain but not endowed with the brains requisite for
that line of life. Thus, the Author, unconsciously, has created him.
But Mr. <span class="smcap">Hare</span> invests this feather-headed scoundrel with Iago-ish and
Mephistophelian characteristics, that go very near to make the
audience believe that, after all, there <i>is</i> something in the part,
and also in the plot. But the part is only a snowman, and melts away
under the sunlight of criticism. Miss <span class="smcap">Kate Rorke</span> is charming. It is a
monotonous and wearisome part, and the merit of it is her own. Miss
<span class="smcap">Norreys</span> is very good but the girl is insipid. Miss <span class="smcap">Compton</span>, as the
good-hearted, knowing, fast lady, wins us, as she proves herself to be
the real <i>Robin Goodfellow</i>, the real good fairy of the piece, <i>Robin
Goodfellow</i> is a misnomer, unless the aforesaid <i>Robin</i> be dissociated
from <i>Puck</i>: but it is altogether a bad title as applied to this piece
for, as with Mr. <span class="smcap">Carton</span>'s piece at the St. James's, <i>Liberty Hall</i>, it
is a title absolutely thrown away. Mr. <span class="smcap">Forbes Robertson</span> is as good as
the part permits, and it is the Author's fault that he is not better.
Mr. <span class="smcap">Gilbert Hare</span> gives a neat bit of character as the Doctor, and Mr.
<span class="smcap">Donald Robertson</span> may by now have made something of the rather foolish
Clergyman (whether Rector, Vicar, or Curate I could not make out),
whose stupid laugh began by making a distinct hit, and, on frequent
repetition, became a decided bore. It is played in one Scene and three
Acts, and no doubt in the course of a fortnight certain repetitious
and needless lines will have been excised, and the piece will play
closer, and may be an attraction, but not a great one, for some time
to come. At all events, the part of <i>Valentine Barbrook</i> will add
another highly-finished picture to Mr. <span class="smcap">Hare's</span> gallery of eccentric
comedy-character. I think of him with delight, and exclaim, once
more&mdash;Admirable!</p>
